      <a>Q.What Is Organic Farming?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span style="color: gray;font-size: 20px;">Sol:</span>Organic farming is a system, which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives etc) and to the maximum extent feasible relies upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral grade rock additives and biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant protection.</p>

      <a>Q.What Seeds should I select?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span style="color: gray;font-size: 20px;">Sol:</span>Seed is a critical and basic input for attaining higher crop yields and sustained growth in agricultural production. Distribution of assured quality seed is as critical as the production of such seeds. Unfortunately, good quality seeds are out of reach of the majority of farmers, especially small and marginal farmers mainly because of exorbitant prices of better seeds.

In order to solve this problem, the Government of India established the National Seeds Corporation (NSC) in 1963 and the State Farmers Corporation of India (SFCI) in 1969. Thirteen State Seed Corporations (SSCs) were also established to augment the supply of improved seeds to the farmers.</p>

      <a>Q.Manures, Fertilizers and Biocides?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span style="color: gray;font-size: 20px;">Sol:</span>Indian soils have been used for growing crops over thousands of years without caring much for replenishing.<br/> This has led to depletion and exhaustion of soils resulting in their low productivity. The average yields of almost all the crops are among t e lowest in the world. This is a serious problem which can be solved by using more manures and fertilizers.<br/>

Manures and fertilizers play the same role in relation to soils as good food in relation to body.<br/> Just as a well-nourished body is capable of doing any good job, a well nourished soil is capable of giving good yields.<br/> It has been estimated that about 70 per cent of growth in agricultural production can be attributed to increased fertilizer application.</p>

      <a>Q.What is Irrigation?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span style="color: gray;font-size: 20px;">Sol:</span>Although India is the second largest irrigated country of the world after China, only one-third of the cropped area is under irrigation.<br/> Irrigation is the most important agricultural input in a tropical monsoon country like India where<br/> rainfall is uncertain, unreliable and erratic India cannot achieve sustained progress in agriculture unless and until more than half of the cropped area is brought under assured irrigation.
<br/>
This is testified by the success story of agricultural progress in Punjab Haryana and western part of Uttar Pradesh where over half of the cropped <br/>area is under irrigation! Large tracts still await irrigation to boost the agricultural output.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Q.What is solution of Lack of mechanisation?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span style="color: gray;font-size: 20px;">Sol:</span>In spite of the large scale mechanisation of agriculture in some parts of the country,<br/> most of the agricultural operations in larger parts are carried on by human hand using simple and conventional tools and implements like wooden plough, sickle, etc.
<br/>
Little or no use of machines is made in ploughing, sowing, irrigating, thinning and pruning, weeding, harvesting threshing and transporting the crops. <br/>This is specially the case with small and marginal farmers. It results in huge wastage of human labour and in low yields per capita labour force.</p>
